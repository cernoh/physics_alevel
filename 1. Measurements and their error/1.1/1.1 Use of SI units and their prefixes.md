# 1.1 Use of SI units and their prefixes

Are fundamental units. Made up of:

| SI Unit   | Measurement         |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Kilograms | Mass                |
| Metres    | Length              |
| Seconds   | Time                |
| Moles     | Amount of substance |
| Kelvin    | Temperature         |
| Amperes   | Electric Current    |

Can be derived from their equation , e.g $f = ma$

Also have prefixes that can be added before SI units:

| name  | Symbol | Multiplier |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| Tera  | T      | $10^{12}$  |
| Giga  | G      | $10^{9}$   |
| Mega  | M      | $10^{6}$   |
| Kilo  | k      | $10^{3}$   |
| Centi | c      | $10^{-2}$  |
| Milli | m      | $10^{-3}$  |
| Micro |  Î¼      | $10^{-6}$  |
| Nano  | n      | $10^{-9}$  |
| Pico  | p      | $10^{-12}$ |
| Femto | f      | $10^{-15}$           |
