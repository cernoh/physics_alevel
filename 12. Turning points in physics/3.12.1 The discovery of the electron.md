# 3.12.1 The discovery of the electron

## 3.12.1.1 - cathode rays
When potential difference applied across [[Discharge Tube]] , tube glows. 

Glows brightest at [[Cathode]] - called [[Cathode Rays|Cathode ray]] 
Glows brightest because gas ions and electrons recombine and emit [[photon|photons]] .

Thompson showed they have:
- mass 
- negative charge 
- the same properties no matter what gas
- Very large charge to mass ratio

Soon concluded all atoms contained cathode ray particles, renamed [[Electron]]

### how a discharge tube glows
1) high p.d across discharge tube pulls electrons off the gas atoms - creating ions and electron pairs
2) positive gas ions accelerated towards cathode - upon collision they release more electrons
3) electrons accelerated along tube (gas at low pressure so accelerated to high speeds) and collide with gas atoms causing them to become [[Excitation|excited]] . When atoms de excite , release photons of light.

## 3.12.1.2 - Thermionic emission
![[Thermionic Emission]]

![[Electron Gun]]

Electrons travel at constant velocity

work done by particle in electric field is $\Delta W = Q \Delta V$ therefore work done on an electron accelerated through potential difference V is:

$$\LARGE \Delta W = eV$$
where e = charge of an electron

measured in [[Electron Volt]]

as electron moves [[cathode]] -> [[anode]] , electrical potential energy -> [[kinetic energy]], therefore electron speeds up.

once reaches anode, $E_k \equiv$ work done by electron by electric field
$$\Large \frac{1}{2}mv^2=eV$$
## 3.12.1.3 Specific charge of the electron

2 different methods 

### fine beam tube
contains low pressure gas and has uniform [[Magnetic Field]]

![[Pasted image 20220305205414.png]]
1) [[electron|Electrons]] are accelerated using an electron gun and enter the fine beam tube perpendicular to direction of the field 
2) magnetic force on the electron perpendicular to motion, therefore electrons move in circular path - magnetic field acts as [[centripetal force]]
3) electrons collide with gas atoms causing them to become [[Excitation|excited]], gas atoms de-excite releasing [[Photon|photons]]

derivation:

### Thompsons crossed fields
[[Magnetic Field]] and [[Electric Field]]
perpendicular to each other - deflect electrons in opposite directions

![[Pasted image 20220305210730.png]]

1) [[Electron|electrons]] accelerated using an [[electron gun]] and enter perpendicular to direction of both fields. deflected up by electric field, downward by magnetic field.
2) strength adjusted until electron beam passes through crossed fields undeflected, therefore both fields equal and opposite

Thompsons discovery significant - showed specific charge is constant no matter what gas used
shows all atoms contain [[electron]]s , leading to plum pudding model

## 3.12.1.4 Principle of Milikan's determination of the electronic charge, e
oil drop experiment
![[Pasted image 20220305212210.png]]
atomizer used to spray tiny droplets of oil - negatively charged due to friction. 
drops fall until they reach two parallel plates, form uniform [[electric field]] 
droplets charged therefore experience electric force. 
strength of field can be adjusted by changing potential difference, until oil droplet is stationary, meaning $mg=EQ$

$$\frac{QV}{d}=mg \quad \text{using} \quad E = \frac{V}{d}$$ Where Q is the charge of the droplet, V is the potential difference across the parallel plates, d is the distance between the plates and m is the mass of the droplet.

cannot find magnitude of charge on oil drop because mass is unknown, therefore mass of oil drop must be found before

To do this, p.d on plates removed, so droplets no longer experience electric force and begin to fall. droplet will experience resistive force upwards (viscous drag force) and it's weight downward. 

Viscous drag force is calculated using :

![[Stokesâ€™ Law]]
terminal velocity measured using microscope with calibrated graticule and measuring distance travelled by the droplet in a certain amount of time.

When moving at terminal velocity, viscous force = weight

![[Pasted image 20220305220534.png]]
where $\rho$ is density of oil, $r$ is droplet radius, and $\eta$ is viscosity of fluid

radius can be found , therefore its mass can be measured , so charge can be calculated

$$\frac{QV}{d}=mg$$
$$\frac{QV}{d}= \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho g$$
Charge of all oil droplets Milikan observed was an integer multiple of $1.6 \times10^-19 C$ 

significant because shows charge is **quantised**, meaning it exists in discrete packets of $1.6 \times10^-19 C$ which is the smallest possible magnitude of charge, the magnitude carried by an electron
