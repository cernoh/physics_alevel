# 3.12.1 The discovery of the electron

## 3.12.1.1 - cathode rays
When potential difference applied across [[Discharge Tube]] , tube glows. 

Glows brightest at [[Cathode]] - called [[Cathode Rays|Cathode ray]] 
Glows brightest because gas ions and electrons recombine and emit [[photon|photons]] .

Thompson showed they have:
- mass 
- negative charge 
- the same properties no matter what gas
- Very large charge to mass ratio

Soon concluded all atoms contained cathode ray particles, renamed [[Electron]]

### how a discharge tube glows
1) high p.d across discharge tube pulls electrons off the gas atoms - creating ions and electron pairs
2) positive gas ions accelerated towards cathode - upon collision they release more electrons
3) electrons accelerated along tube (gas at low pressure so accelerated to high speeds) and collide with gas atoms causing them to become [[Excitation|excited]] . When atoms de excite , release photons of light.

## 3.12.1.2 - Thermionic emission
![[Thermionic Emission]]

![[Electron Gun]]

Electrons travel at constant velocity

work done by particle in electric field is $\Delta W = Q \Delta V$ therefore work done on an electron accelerated through potential difference V is:

$$\LARGE \Delta W = eV$$
where e = charge of an electron

measured in [[Electron Volt]]

as electron moves [[cathode]] -> [[anode]] , electrical potential energy -> [[kinetic energy]], therefore electron speeds up.

once reaches anode, $E_k \equiv$ work done by electron by electric field
$$\Large \frac{1}{2}mv^2=eV$$
## 3.12.1.3 Specific charge of the electron

2 different methods 

### fine beam tube
contains low pressure gas and has uniform [[Magnetic Field]]

![[Pasted image 20220305205414.png]]
1) [[electron|Electrons]] are accelerated using an electron gun and enter the fine beam tube perpendicular to direction of the field 
2) magnetic force on the electron perpendicular to motion, therefore electrons move in circular path - magnetic field acts as [[centripetal force]]
3) electrons collide with gas atoms causing them to become [[Excitation|excited]], gas atoms de-excite releasing [[Photon|photons]]
