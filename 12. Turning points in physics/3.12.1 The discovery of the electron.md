# 3.12.1 The discovery of the electron

## 3.12.1.1 - cathode rays
When potential difference applied across [[Discharge Tube]] , tube glows. 

Glows brightest at [[Cathode]] - called [[Cathode Rays|Cathode ray]]

Thompson showed they have:
- mass 
- negative charge 
- the same properties no matter what gas
- Very large charge to mass ratio

Soon concluded all atoms contained cathode ray particles, renamed [[Electron]]

### now a discharge tube glows
1) high p.d across discharge tube pulls electrons off the gas atoms - creating ions and electron pairs
2) positive gas ions accelerated towards cathode - upon collision they release more electrons
3) electrons accelerated along tube (gas at low pressure so accelerated to high speeds) and collide wia
