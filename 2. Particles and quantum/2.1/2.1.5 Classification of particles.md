# 2.1.5 Classification of particles
All particles are either [[Hadrons]] or [[Lepton|Leptons]]

Leptons are [[fundemental particles]] , however [[hadrons]] are formed of [[Quark|quarks]].

[[Hadrons]] can be further seperated into [[Baryon|baryons]], [[Antibaryons]], and [[Meson|Mesons]]

[[Baryon Number]] is always conserved

[[Proton]] is the only stable [[Baryon]], therefore all baryons eventually decay into a proton directly or indirectly.

[[Lepton Number]] always conserved in particle interactions

[[Muon]]

[[Strange Particles]] 
[[Strangeness]] can change by 0, +1, -1 in [[Weak Nuclear Force|Weak interactoins]], but conserved in [[Strong Nuclear Force|Strong interactions]]
