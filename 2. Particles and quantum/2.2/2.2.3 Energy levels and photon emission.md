# 2.2.3 Energy levels and photon emission
Passing light from a flourescent tube through a [[Diffraction grating]] gives you a [[Line spectrum]]

Each line represents a different wavelength of light emitted by the tube. Contains [[Discrete value|discrete values]] of wavelength only. The photon energies emitted will correspond to those wavelengths.

Evidence to show that electrons in atoms can only transition between [[Energy Levels|Discrete energy levels.]]

Difference between two energy levels is equal to a specific photon energy emitted by a flourescent tube , or aborbed in a line absorption spectrum.

$$\Delta E = E_{1}-E_{2}$$
Where $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ represent energy levels.
As $E = hf$, $hf = E_{1}-E_{2}$
