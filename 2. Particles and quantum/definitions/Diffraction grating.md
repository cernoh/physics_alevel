# Diffraction grating
A grating with hundreds of slits per millimetre, that results in sharper interference patterns. Used to calculate atomic spacing and to analyse elements.

### formula 
### $$d\sin{\theta} = n \lambda$$
where d is the distance, $\theta$ is the angle, n is the order, ad $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

max value of $\sin{\theta}$ is one, so any value of n that gives $\sin{\theta}$ as greater than 1 are impossible.
