# 2.1.2 Stable and unstable nuclei
[[Strong Nuclear Force]] keeps nuclei stable by counteracting the electrostatic force of repulsion betwen protons in the nucleus, due to them having the same charge.
Only acts on nucleons and has a very short range.

Unstable nuclei are those which have too many:
- [[Proton|protons]]
- [[Neutron|neutrons]]
- or both.

Causes [[Strong Nuclear Force]] to not be enough to keep them stable, therefore these nuclei will decay in order to become stable. The type of decay the nuclei will eperience depends on the amount of each nucleon in them.
- If the nuclei is large, with both too many protons and neutrons : [[Alpha decay]]
- If the nuclei is neutron rich : [[Beta-minus decay]]

[[Neutrino|Neutrinos]] were discovered to be in [[Beta-minus decay]] by observations of the energy levels of the particles before and after and finding that the energy wasn't conserved if it only emitted an electron, therefore it needed an extra particle.
