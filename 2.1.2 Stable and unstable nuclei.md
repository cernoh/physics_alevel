# 2.1.2 Stable and unstable nuclei
[[Strong Nuclear Force]] keeps nuclei stable by counteracting the electrostatic force of repulsion betwen protons in the nucleus, due to them having the same charge.
Only acts on nucleons and has a very short range.

Unstable nuclei are those which have too many:
- [[Proton|protons]]
- [[Neutron|neutrons]]
- or both.

Causes [[Strong Nuclear Force]] to not be enough to keep them stable, therefore these nuclei will decay in order to become stable. The type of [[deca]]
