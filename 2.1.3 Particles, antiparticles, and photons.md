# 2.1.3 Particles, antiparticles, and photons
### [[Antiparticle]]
![[Pasted image 20211101184307.png]]

EM radiation travels in packets called [[Photon|photons]], which transfers energy and have no mass. 

#### $$energy\: of\: photons\propto frequency\: of\: EM\: radiation \large$$
 #### $$E =  hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$ 
 where h = [[Planck's Constant]]

### [[Annihilation]] 
Used in a PET scanner
Allows 3D images of the inside of the body to be taken , making medical diagnoses easier. Done by introducing a [[Positron|positron-emitting]] radioisotope into the patient, as positrons are released they annihilate electrons already in the patients system. Emits gamma photons which can easily be detected.

### [[Pair Production]]
