# 2.1.7 Application of conservation laws

The properties that must always be conserved in particle interactions are:
- Energy & Momentum
- Charge
- Baryon
- Electron lepton number
- Muon lepton number

related:
[[Lepton Number]]

Strangeness only conserved during strong interactions.

To show conservation laws are obeyed, find the value of each property *before* and *after* the interaction and make sure they are equal.

### example interaction:
(beta minus decay)

### $$n \rightarrow p + e^{-} + \overline v_e$$
|     | Charge | Baryon 
| --- | ------ |
