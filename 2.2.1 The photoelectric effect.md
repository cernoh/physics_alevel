# 2.2.1 The photoelectric effect

Where photoelectrons are emitted from the surface of a metal after light above a [[Threshold Frequency|certain frequency]] (known as the threshold frequency).

Threshold frequency *can't* be explained by wave theory, as it suggests frequency should be able to cause photoelectric emission as the energy absorbed by each electron will gradually increase. However can be explained by **photon model of light** that suggests that:
- EM waves travel as [[photon|photons]], where $energy \propto frequency$
- Each electron absorbs a single photon.
- If frequency is above threshold, $\uparrow \:intensity \:of \:light = \: \uparrow \:photoelectrons\: emitted/second$
