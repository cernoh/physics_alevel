# 2.2.2 Collisions of electrons with atoms

Electrons can only exist in [[Energy Levels]]
- Gain energy from collisions with free [[Electron|electrons]], which cause them to move up in energy level.
- gaining energy =  [[excitation]] or [[ionisation]]

If electron is excited, will quickly return to its orginial ne
