# 2.2.2 Collisions of electrons with atoms

Electrons can only exist in [[Energy Levels]]
- Gain energy from collisions with free [[Electron|electrons]], which cause them to move up in energy level.
- gaining energy =  [[excitation]] or [[ionisation]]

If electron is excited, will quickly return to its orginial energy level and therefore release the energy it gained in the form of a [[photon]].

## Practical use:
- Fluorescent tubes filled with mercury vapour.
- high voltage applied across it

- Voltage accelerates free [[Electron|electrons]] through tube.
- collide with mercury atmos causing them to be [[Ionisation|ionised]]
- releasing more free electrons
- Free electrons collide with mercury atoms
- causing them to become [[Excitation|excited]]
- When they de-excite, they release photons, in the UV range
- flourescent coating inside tube absorbs UV photons
- Electrons in coating de-excite releasing photons of visible light
