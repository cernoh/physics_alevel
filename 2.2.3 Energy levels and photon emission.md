# 2.2.3 Energy levels and photon emission
Passing light from a flourescent tube through a [[Diffraction grating]] gives you a [[Line spectrum]]

Each line represents a different wavelength of light emitted by the tube. Contains [[Discrete value|discrete values]] of wavelength only. The photon energies emitted will correspond to those wavelengths.

Evidence to show that electrons in atoms can only transition between [[Energy Levels|Discrete energy levels.]
