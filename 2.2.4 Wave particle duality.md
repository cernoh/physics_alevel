# 2.2.4 Wave particle duality

[[2.2.1 The photoelectric effect|Light can be shown as having both wave and particle properties]]. 

Examples of light being a wave are [[Diffraction grating|diffraction]] and interference.

Electrons shown to have wave and particle properties, as the wave nateru of electrons can be observed through [[Electron Diffraction]], as only waves can experience diffraction.

[De Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie) hypothesised that if light was shown to have particle properties, then particles should also have wave like properties. He wrote an equation linking wavelength of an object to its momentum.
