# 3.1.3 Principle of superposition of waves and formation of stationary waves

[[Superposition]]
[[Stationary Wave]]

Lowest frequency at which a stationary wave forms is the *first harmonic*, forms a stationary wave with two [[node|nodes]] and a single [[antinode]].

Distance between adjacent nodes (for antinodes) is half a wavelength, for any harmonic.

$$f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
where L is length of the vibrating string, T is the tension, and $\mu$ is the mass per unit length

Double first harmonic frequency to find the second harmonic where there are 2 antinodes,  triple to get third harmonic, and so on the nth harmonic
