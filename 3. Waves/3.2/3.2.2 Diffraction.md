# 3.2.2 Diffraction
[[Diffraction]]
Greatest diffraction occurs when the gap is the same size as the wavelength.
- When gap is smaller than the wavelength most waves are reflected
- When gap is larger there's less noticeable diffraction


[[Single slit interference]]
Increasing slit width decreases amount of diffraction, therefore central maxima becomes narrower and its intensity increases.
Increasing light wavelength increases the amount diffraction as the slit is closer to size to the lights wavelength, therefore central maxima becomes wider and intensity decreases.
