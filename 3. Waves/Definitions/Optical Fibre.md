# Optical Fibre
A thin glass fibre through which signals are passed through. Usually have [[Cladding]] surrounding them, protecting the core from damage and preventing signal degradation through light escaping the core.

To allow the wave to go further they use  [[Total Internal Reflection|TIR]], as Cladding has a lower optical density .
