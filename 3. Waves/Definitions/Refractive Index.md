# Refractive Index
A material property that is equal to the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum, and the speed of light in a given material. A higher refractive index can also be known as being more optically dense.

As light doesn't slow down significantly when traveling through air, the refractive index of air is approx. 1.

### formula
### $$n = c/c_{s}$$
where n is the refractive index, c is the [[Speed of light in a vaccum]], and $c_{s}$ is the speed of light in that substance
