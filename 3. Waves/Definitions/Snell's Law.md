# Snell's Law
A law linking a wave's angle of incidence to its angle of refraction, with the use of the [[Refractive Index|refractive indexes]] of the mediums involved.

### Formula
### $$n_{1}\sin{\theta_{1}} = n_{2}\sin{\theta_{2}}$$
where $n_{1}$ is the refractive index of material one , $n_{2}$ the refractive index of material two, $\theta_{1}$ the angle of incidence of the ray in material one, and $\theta_{2}$ the angle of refraction of the ray in material two.
