# Total Internal Reflection
An effect that occurs in [[Optical Fibre|optical fibres]], where full reflection occurs at the inside boundary of the fibre, meaning no radiation passes out.
occurs when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle and the incident refractive index ($n_{1}$) is greater than the refractive index ($n_2$) of the material of the boundary
