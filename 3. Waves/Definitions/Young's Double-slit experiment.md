# Young's Double-slit experiment
An experiment that demonstrates the diffraction of light by each passing [[Monochromatic Light]] across two narrow slits and observing the resulting pattern of bright and dark fringes.

- Shine a coherent light through 2 slits about the same size as the wavelength of the laser light so the light [[Diffraction|diffracts]]
- Each slit acts as a [[coherence|coherent point source]] making a pattern of light and dark fringes. 
	- Light fringes are formed when the light meets [[Phase Difference|in phase]] and [[Interference|interferes constructively]]. 
	- Dark fringes are formed where the light meets completely out of phase and interferes constructively 
	
### formula
$$ W = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
where w is fringe spacing, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light used, D is the distance between the screen and slits, and s is slit separation .
