# Young's Double-slit experiment
An experiment that demonstrates the diffraction of light by each passing [[Monochromatic Light]] across two narrow slits and observing the resulting pattern of bright and dark fringes.

- Shine a coherent light through 2 slits about the same size as the wavelength of the laser light so the light [[Diffraction|diffracts]]
- Each slit acts as a [[coherence|coherent point source]] making a pattern of light and dark fringes. Light fringes are formed when the light meets [[ph|in phase]] and interferes constructively.
