# 3.1.1 progressive waves

Transfers energy without transferring material and is made up of particles of a medium (or field) oscillating e.g. water waves are made of water particles moving up and down.

[[Amplitude]]
[[Frequency]]
[[Wavelength]]
[[Speed]]
[[Phase]]
[[Phase Difference]]
[[Period]]

Two points in a wave are [[Phase|in phase]] if they are both at the same point of the wave cycle. 
Will have same:
- displacement
- Velocity
Phase difference will be a multiple of $360 \degrees$
