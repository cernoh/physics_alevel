[[Superposition]]
[[Stationary Wave]]

Lowest frequency at which a stationary wave forms is the *first harmonic*, forms a stationary wave with two [[node|nodes]] and a single [[antinode]].

Distance between adjacent nodes (for antinodes) is half a wavelength, for any harmonic.

$$f = \frac{1}{2L}$$
