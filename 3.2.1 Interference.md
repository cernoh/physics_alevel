# 3.2.1 Interference
[[Path Difference]]
[[Coherence]]

Laser normally used as sources of light in diffraction as they form clear interference patterns, because they are [[Coherence|coherent]] and [[Monochromatic Light|monochromatic]]

[[Young's Double-slit experiment]]
White light instead of [[Monochromatic Light]] gives wider maxima and a less intense diffraction pattern, with a central white fringe with alternating bright fringes which are spectra.

Lasers can damage your eyesight, therefore when using lasers there are several safety precautions :
- Wear laser safety goggles
- Don't shine a laser at reflective surfaces
- Display a warning sign
- Never shine the laser at a person
