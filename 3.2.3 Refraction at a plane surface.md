# 3.2.3 Refraction at a plane surface


[[Refractive Index]]
![[Refractive Index#n c c_ s]]

Refraction happens when a wave enters a different medium, causing it to change direction, either towards or away from the normal depending on the materials refractive index

![[Snell's Law]]
As light moves across the boundary, the speed changes, which causes direction to change
when angle of incidence is increased the angle of refraction also increases until it gets closer to $90\degree$. When its exactly $90\degree$ and the light is refracted along the boundary, the angle of incidence had reached the critical angle ($\theta_{c}$) . It can be found using:

### $\sin(\theta_{c}) = n_{2}/n_{1}$
where $n_{1} < n_{2}$
