# 3.2.3 Refraction at a plane surface


[[Refractive Index]]
![[Refractive Index#n c c_ s]]

Refraction happens when a wave enters a different medium, causing it to change direction, either towards or away from the normal depending on the materials refractive index

![[Snell's Law]]
As light moves across the boundary, the speed changes, which causes direction to change
