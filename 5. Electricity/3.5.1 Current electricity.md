## 3.5.1.3 Resistivity
![[Resistivity]]
Can be effected by environmental factors

$\uparrow$ temperature = $\uparrow$ resistance
Because atoms of the metal gain [[kinetic energy]] and move more, causing [[electron|electrons]] to collide with atoms more frequently, meaning they slow down, therefore current decreases and so resistance increases.
