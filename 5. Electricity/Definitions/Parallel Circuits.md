# Parallel Circuits
Components are said to be connected in parallel when they are connected across each other (separate loops)

Sum of [[Current]] in each parallel set of branches = total current
[[potential difference]] is the same in each branch

## Resistance
$$ \frac{1}{R_t}= \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_22} + \frac{1}{R_3} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$$
## voltage
$$V_t = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = ... $$
