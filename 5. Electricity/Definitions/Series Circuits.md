# Series Circuits
Components are said to be connected in series when they are connected end to end (in one loop)

[[Current]] is same everywhere
battery [[potential difference]] shared across all elements  , therefore  $\sum$ Voltage across all elements = supply p.d

## resistance
$$ R_t =R_1 + R_2 + R_3 +... +R_n $$
