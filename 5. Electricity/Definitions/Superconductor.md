# Superconductor
A material which has zero [[resistivity]] when the temperature is decreased to, or below, the materialâ€™s critical temperature. Superconductors can be used to produce strong magnetic fields and reduce energy loss when transmitting electric power
Critical temperature normally around 0K (-273$\degree$C)
