# 6.1.2 Simple Harmonic Motion

Occurs when an objects acceleration $\propto$ displacement in opposite direction

$$a \propto x$$
$$a = -kx$$
$$a = -\omega^{2}x$$

## example - simple pendulum

oscillates around central midpoint 
- equilibrium position

x = displacement
A = Amplitude, max displacement
T = time period , found by measuring time of 1 oscillation

## formulas
$$x = Acos \omega t$$
$$ v = \pm \omega \sqrt{(A^{2}-x^{2})}$$

## graphs
Displacement time , where A  = max displacement and T = time period

Velocity time , where $\omega A$ = max velocity and T = time period. Can be derived from displacement time

Acceleration time , where $\omega^{2}A$ = max acceleration , and T = time period. Can be derived from velocity time
