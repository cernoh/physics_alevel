# 6.1.3 Simple harmonic systems
Oscillate with [[6.1.2 Simple Harmonic Motion]]

For any system , kinetic -> potential and back during oscillation
Amplitude = maximum amount of potential
as it moves toward equilibrium, potential -> kinetic
at centre kinetic is at maximum
total energy of system is constant

## Examples:

### simple pendulum 
![[6.1.2 Simple Harmonic Motion#example - simple pendulum]]

Only oscillates with SHM when displaced with a **small angle** , since small angle approximation used in equation

During SHM, gravitational potential -> kinetic -> gravitational potential during oscillations

#### Equation

<font size = "5">$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$</font>
where $T$ = time period, $l$= length of string, and $g$= acceleration due to gravity

### Mass- Spring System

Spring either vertical or horizontal

in vertical:
-> kinetic energy converted to elastic and gravitational potential 

in horizontal:
-> kinetic energy only converted to elastic potential

#### Equations
<font size = "5">$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$ </font>
Where $T$= time period, $m$ = mass, and $k$ = spring constant


## Damping
When energy is lost to the environment
- light damping/underdamping -amplitude gradually decreases by small amounts each oscillation
- Critical damping - reduces amplitude to zero in shortest possible time 
- Heavy damping/overdamping - Amplitude decreases slower than with critical damping
