# 3.6.2.1 Thermal energy transfer
![[Internal Energy]] 

increases in two ways:
- Do work on the system to transfer energy to it
- Increase temperature of the system

[[State Changes]] , internal energy changes

can be demonstrated by measuring temperature of water as it boils:
- Temperature increases up until 100$\degree$C after which the energy gained is used to break bonds to change state.
