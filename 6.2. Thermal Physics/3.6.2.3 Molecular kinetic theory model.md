# 3.6.2.3 Molecular kinetic theory model

[[Brownian Motion]]

You can use a simple molecular model to explain each of the gas laws: 
- **Boyle’s law** - Pressure is inversely proportional to volume at *constant temperature* E.g If you increase the volume of a fixed mass of gas, its molecules will move further apart so collisions will be less frequent therefore pressure decreases. 
- **Charles’s law** - Volume is directly proportional to temperature at *constant pressure* When the temperature of a gas is increased, its molecules gain kinetic energy meaning they will move more quickly and because pressure is kept constant (therefore frequency of collisions is constant) the molecules move further apart and volume is increased. 
- **Pressure Law** - Pressure is directly proportional to temperature at *constant volume* When the temperature of a gas is increased, its molecules gain kinetic energy meaning they will move more quickly, as volume is constant the frequency of collisions between molecules and their container increases and they collide at higher speeds therefore pressure is increased.

assumptions-
- No intermolecular forces
- Duration of collisions negligible in comparison to time between collisions
- motion is random, and collisions are perfectly elastic
- motion follows Newtons laws
- move in straight lines between collisions
