# Pressure Law
The pressure of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, when the volume is fixed

Using the system below, if you plot pressure against temperature in kelvins, you get a  straight line through the origin.

### $$\frac{p}{T} = constant$$
where p = pressure and T = temperature in kelvins
