# 3.7.1 Fields

Force field:
Area which an object experiences **non contact force**. 

Represented as vectors or with field lines.

Formed during interaction of masses, static charge or moving charges.

main types: **gravitational** and **electric**

| Follow inverse square law   | gravitational is always attractive, electric can be attractive or repulsive |
| use field lines             | electric forces act on charge, gravitational act on mass                                                                            |
| have equipotential surfaces |                                                                             |
