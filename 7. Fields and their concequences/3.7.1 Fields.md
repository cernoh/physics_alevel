 # 3.7.1 Fields

[[force field]]

can be represented as vectors, describes direction of the force that  would be exerted on the object.

can be represented as diagrams containing [[Field Line or Line of Force|field lines]]



[[force field|Force fields]] are formed during the interaction of masses, static charge or moving charges.
Different types of fields are formed depending on which interaction takes place:
- **Gravitational fields** - formed during the interaction of masses
- **Electric fields** - formed during the interaction of charges

| Both follow inverse square law    | In gravitational fields, the force exerted is always attractive, while in electric fields the force can be either repulsive or attractive |
| Use field lines to be represented | Electric force acts on charge, while gravitational force acts on mass                                                                     |
| Both have equipotential surfaces                                  |                                                                                                                                           |
