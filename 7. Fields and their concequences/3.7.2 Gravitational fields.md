# 3.7.2 Gravitational fields

## 3.7.2.1 - Newtons Law
[[Gravity]] acts on any objects with **mass**
always attractive

[[Newton's law of gravitation]]

## 3.7.2.2 - Gravitational field strength

| uniform                             | Radial                            |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Same gravitational force everywhere | Force exerted depends on position |
| Parallel and equally spaced lines   | Magnitude decreases with distance |

Earths gravitational field is radial but close to surface its uniform

Gravitational field strength (g)

$$\LARGE g=\frac{F}{M} \qquad g=\frac{GM}{r^2} \text{(for a radial field)} $$

## 3.7.2.3 - Gravitational Potential
(V) at a point
where work done per unit mass when moving an object from infinity to that point

at infinity = 0
energy released 

$$\large V=-\frac{GM}{r}\text{ (for a radial field)
}$$
Gravitational potential difference ($\Delta V$ )
Energy needed to move a unit mass between two points
can be used to find work done when moving an object

$$\large \text{Work done}= m\Delta V$$
m = mass of object moved
