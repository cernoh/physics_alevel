# 3.7.2 Gravitational fields

## 3.7.2.1 Newtons law
Acts on any object with **mass**
always attractive

> The magnitude of gravitational force between two masses is directly proportional to product of masses, and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

$$\LARGE F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
where G is gravitational constant, m1/m2 are masses and r is distance between centre of masses

## 3.7.2.2 Gavitational field strength
2 types:
- uniform
- radial

Arrows show direction that force acts on a mass

Uniform:
->same gravitational force on a mass everywhere
-> parallel and equally spaced lines

In radial force goes down further you are from core.
Earth has radial field but close to the surface its almost completely uniform


### Gravitational field strength
>force per unit mass exerted by gravitational field on an object
>constant in uniform field, but varies ini radial field

#### Formulas
$$\LARGE g=\frac{F}{M}$$

ONLY FOR RADIAL FIELD:
$$\LARGE g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$
## 3.7.2.3 Graviational potential
>Work done per unit mass when moving an object from infinity to that point

Graviational potential at infinity = 0
infinity -> a point, energy released as  GPE is reduced
therefore always neagtive

$$\LARGE V= -\frac{GM}{r}$$ For a radial field

Gravitational potential difference:
>energy needed to move a unit mass between two points

can be used to find the work done

$$\LARGE Work\:done = m\Delta V$$
where $m$ is mass of object moved

[[equipotential]]

graviational potential is **inversely proportional** to **distance** between **two centres**.

Gravitational field strength -> found by drawing a tangent to the curve at that distance and finding gradient 

$$\LARGE g = \frac{-\Delta V}{\Delta r}$$

## 3.7.2.4 Orbits of planets and satellites
Keplers third law:
>square of orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the radius
