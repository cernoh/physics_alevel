always attractive

[[Newton's law of gravitation]]

| Same gravitational force everywhere | Force exerted depends on position |
| Parallel and equally spaced lines   | Magnitude decreases with distance |

Earths gravitational field is radial but close to surface its uniform

Gravitational field strength (g)

$$\LARGE g=\frac{F}{M} \qquad g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$
