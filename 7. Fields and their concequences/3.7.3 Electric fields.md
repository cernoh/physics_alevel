## 3.7.3.1 - Coulomb's law

[[Coulomb's law]]

air can be treated as vacuum

If signs:
- same, force = repulsive
- different, force = repulsive

magnitude of electrostatic forces between subatomic particles is magnitudes greater than the magnitude of gravitational forces
because mass is smaller

## 3.7.3.2 - Electric field strength
(E)
Force per unit charge experienced by an object in an electric field.
Value constant in a uniform field, varies in a radial field

for uniform fields:
$$\large E=\frac{F}{Q} \quad E= \frac{V}{d}$$

for radial fields:
$$\large \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2}$$

fields lines dierection of positive charge
uniform field has same electric forced everywhere, radial field magnitude depends on distance between two charge

Uniform electric fields can be used to find if a particle is charged:
- fire particle at right angles to the field and observe path
- If charged, will experience a constant electric force , causing acceleration $\therefore$ will follow a parabolic shape

## 3.7.3.3 - Electric potential
[[electric potential]]

Value sign depends on sign of charge (Q) 

if sign is:

|           | Positive  | Negative   |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Potential** | positive  | negative   |
| **Force **    | repulsive | attractive |

If you plot electric field strength against distance, you can find [[electric potential difference]] from the area under the graph
