# 3.7.3 Electric fields

## 3.7.3.1 Coulomb's law 
>Magnitude of the force between two point charges in a vacuum is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.

$$\LARGE F= \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_o}\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$
where $\varepsilon_o$ is permittivity of free space, Q are charges, and r is distance between charges.

Air can be treated as vacuum

same sign -> repulsive
different signs -> attractive

magnitude of electrostatic forces between subatomic particles is magnitudes greater than the magnitude of gravitational forces
