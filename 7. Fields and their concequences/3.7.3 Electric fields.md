# 3.7.3 Electric fields

## 3.7.3.1 Coulomb's law 
>Magnitude of the force between two point charges in a vacuum is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.

$$\LARGE F= \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_o}\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$
where $\varepsilon_o$ is permittivity of free space, Q are charges, and r is distance between charges.

Air can be treated as vacuum

same sign -> repulsive
different signs -> attractive

magnitude of electrostatic forces between subatomic particles is magnitudes greater than the magnitude of [[3.7.2 Gravitational fields|gravitational forces]]

## 3.7.3.2 Electric field strength
> Force per unit charge experienced by an object in an electric field

constant value in a uniform field but varies in a radial field.

3 formulas:
- general -> $\Large E=\frac{F}{Q}$
- uniform field -> $\Large E=\frac{V}{d}$ 
- radial field -> $\Large E=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_o}\frac{Q}{r^2}$

where v = potential difference across plates, d = distance , $\varepsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space, Q = magnitude of charge, r = distance between charges
