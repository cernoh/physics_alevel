# Coulomb's law
the size of the force that acts between two point charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation. Attractive for opposite charges and repulsive for like charges.

$$\large F \propto \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
where k = $\LARGE \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}$
