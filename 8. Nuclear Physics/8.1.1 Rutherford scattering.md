# 8.1.1 Rutherford scattering

demonstrates the existence of a nucleus. Before scientists believed in the Thomson's [[plum pudding model]]

Rutherford's apparatus included an alpha source and gold foil in an evacuated chamber which war covered in a florescent coating, which meant you could see where the alpha particles hit the inside of the chamber. To observe the path of the alpha particles, there war a microscope which could be moved around the outside of the chamber.

If plum pudding was true, the positively charged alpha particles would be deflected by a very small amount when passing through the foil, however that wasn't observed. 
- Most alpha particles passed straight through the foil with no deflection, this suggested that the atom is mostly empty space, and not a uniform density.
- A small amount of particles were deflected by a large angle, this suggested that the center of the atom is positively charged, as positively charged alpha particles were repelled from the center and deflected. 
- Very few particles were deflected back by more than 90$\degree$ , This suggested that the centre of the atom is incredibly dense.

Concluded that the atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at its centre.
