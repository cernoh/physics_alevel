# 8.1.3 Radioactive decay
[[Random Nature of Radioactive Decay]]
Given radioactive nucleus has constant decay probability denoted by the letter $\lambda$ . Known as **decay constant,** which is the **probability of a nucleus decaying per unit time**. This value can be calculated by finding the change in the number of nuclei ($\Delta N$) of a sample over time ($\Delta t$) , over the initial number of nuclei (N):

### $$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = - \lambda N$$

over long periods of time radioactive decay can be described as an exponential decay through the following formula


### $$N = N_{0}e^{-\lambda t}$$

where $N$ is the number of nuclei, $N_{0}$ is the initial number of nuclei, $\lambda$ is the decay constant, ant t is time passed.

As thee decay is exponential , the time taken for the number of nuclei to halve will be constant, the name for this value is the half-life($T_{\frac{1}{2}}$)
Can determine this value graphically. 

however a more accurate way is by plotting a graph of $ln(N_{0})$ against time, forming a straight line graph. Modulus of the gradient of
