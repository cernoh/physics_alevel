# 8.1.3 Radioactive decay
[[Random Nature of Radioactive Decay]]
Given radioactive nucleus has constant decay probability denoted by the letter $\lambda$ . Known as **decay constant,** which is the **probability of a nucleus decaying per unit time**. This value can be calculated by finding the change in the number of nuclei ($\Delta N$) of a sample over time ($\Delta t$) , over the initial number of nuclei (N):

### $$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = - \lambda N$$

over long periods of time radioactive decay can be described as an exponential decay through the following formula


### $$N = N_{0}e^{-\lambda t}$$

where $N$ is the number of nuclei, $N_{0}$ is the initial number of nuclei, $\lambda$ is the decay constant, ant t is time passed.

As thee decay is exponential , the time taken for the number of nuclei to halve will be constant, the name for this value is the half-life($T_{\frac{1}{2}}$)
Can determine this value graphically. 

however a more accurate way is by plotting a graph of $ln(N_{0})$ against time, forming a straight line graph. Modulus of the gradient of the line is the decay constant. Can be used to find half life.

### proof
$ln(N) = ln(N_{0}e^{-\lambda t})$
$ln(N) = ln(N_{0})+ln(e^{-\lambda t})$   using log rule
$ln(N) = ln(N_{0})-\lambda t$  Rearrange for form y=mx+c
$ln(N) = -\lambda t + ln(N_{0})$

using your measured value of decay constant you can use the following formula (derived by substituting $0.5N_{0}$ for N in the exponential decay equation and rearranging for time)

### $$T_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{ln(2)}{\lambda}$$


## activity
Activity of a radioactive sample is thee number of nuclei that decay per second. This is proportional to the number of nuclei in the sample, where the decay constant is the constant of proportionality

### $$A = \lambda N$$

because activity is directly proportional to the number of nuclei it follows the same exponential decay equation

### $$A = A_{0}e^{-\lambda t}$$

as they are proportional , the time taken for activity to halve is equal to the half life as well. And as the activity of a sample is much easier to measure than the number of nuclei, this is often used to find the half life of a sample.

The decay constant can be used to model the decay of a nuclei only when there is a large number of nuclei in a sample, this is because the decay constant models the number of nuclei decayed by statistical means
