# 8.1.3 Radioactive decay
[[Random Nature of Radioactive Decay]]
Given radioactive nucleus has constant decay probability denoted by the letter $\lambda$ . Known as **decay constant,** which is the **probability of a nucleus decaying per unit time**. This value can be calculated by finding the change in the number of nuclei ($\Delta N$) of a sample over time ($\Delta t$) , over the initial number of nuclei (N):
