# 8.1.4 Nuclear instability

nuclei held together by [[Strong Nuclear Force]], however protons experience a force of repulsion due to the [[Electromagnetic| electromagnetic force]] 

if forces aren't balanced, nuclei will become unstable and will experience radioactive decay.

### Reasons for a nucleus to become unstable
1. Has too many neutrons - decays through [[Beta-minus decay]] 
2. Has too many protons - decays through [[Beta-plus decay]] or [[Electron capture]]
3. Has too many nucleons 
4.
