# 8.1.4 Nuclear instability

nuclei held together by [[Strong Nuclear Force]], however protons experience a force of repulsion due to the [[Electromagnetic| electromagnetic force]] 

if forces aren't balanced, nuclei will become unstable and will experience radioactive decay.

### Reasons for a nucleus to become unstable
1. Has too many neutrons 
	- decays through [[Beta-minus decay]] 

2. Has too many protons 
	- decays through [[Beta-plus decay]] or [[Electron capture]]

3. Has too many nucleons 
	- decays through [[Alpha decay]]

4. Has too much energy
	- decays through [[Gamma Decay]]

may require **multiple decays** to become stable
