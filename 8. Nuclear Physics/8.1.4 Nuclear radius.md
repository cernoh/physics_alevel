# 8.1.4 Nuclear radius


![[distance of closest approach]]

Also can be calculated by **[[electron diffraction]]**.


## Finding nucleus by electron diffraction
Electrons are **leptons** , so they will not interact with nucleons in the nucleus through [[Strong Nuclear Force]] as an [[alpha particle]] would. 
Much more accurate.

An [[Electron]] is accelerated to very high speed so their [[de Broglie wavelength]] is around $10^{-15}m$, and are directed at a very thin film of material in front of a screen causing them to diffract through the gaps between nuclei and form a [[Diffraction| diffraction pattern]]

diffraction pattern formed is a set of concentric circles, with a central bright point. which get dimmer as you move away from the centre, using this pattern you can plot a graph of intensity against diffraction angle from which you can find the diffraction angle of the first minimum.

Using this measurement you can find an estimate of nuclear radius by using the following formula.

<font size = "5"> $$sin\theta = \frac{0.61\lambda}{R}$$ </font>

where $\theta$ is the diffraction angle of the first minimum,  $\lambda$ is the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of the electrons and $R$ is the radius of the nucleus that the electrons were scattered by.
