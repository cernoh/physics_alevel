# 8.1.4 Nuclear radius


![[distance of closest approach]]

Also can be calculated by **[[electron diffraction]]**.


## Finding nucleus by electron diffraction
Electrons are **leptons** , so they will not interact with nucleons in the nucleus through [[Strong Nuclear Force]] as an [[alpha particle]] would. 
Much more accurate.

An [[Electron]] is accelerated to very high speed so their [[D]]
