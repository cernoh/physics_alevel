# 8.1.6 Mass and energy

Mass and energy **interchangeable** at nuclear level.

Can be related by the equation

<font size="5"> $$E = mc^{2}$$</font>
where E = energy, m = mass, and c = [[Speed of light in a vaccum]]

When comparing mass of a nucleus and mass of its constituents , mass of nucleus will always be lower.
Difference known as [[Mass Defect]].

Lost mass becomes energy and released when the nucleons fuse to form a nucleus.

The change in mass incredibly small, therefore use [[Atomic Mass Unit]] to measure the mass difference.

![[Fusion]]
