# 8.1.8 Safety aspects

Fuel used in nuclear reactors is called [[enriched uranium]]

Around reactor is a very thick concrete shielding, which blocks radiation from escaping.
Shielding may become radioactive.

In emergency, [[Control Rods]] can be dropped into reactor core entirely.

[[Fission]] , daughter nuclei are extremely unstable and have very high activity, so needs to be disposed of properly.
Needs to be disposed of properly.

Spent fuel rods known as high level waste, as most dangerous.
Low level rods are only short lived radioactivity e.g. tools and gloves.

Low level can be disposed of close to the surface as it will not take very long to stop being radioactive.

High level needs to be disposed of properly:
- Removed and handled remotely
- Waste is extremely hot so must be placed in cooling ponds for upto a year while they might be producing heat.
- Any usable plutonium or uranium is removed from spent fuel rods in order to be recycled
- Waste is [[vitrified]] , placed in thick steel casks and stored in deep caverns in geologically stable locations
