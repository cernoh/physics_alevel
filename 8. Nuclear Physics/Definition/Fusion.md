# Fusion
The joining of two smaller nuclei to form a larger nucleus and to release energy. Only occurs in fairly small nuclei. Energy released because larger nucleus has higher [[Binding Energy]]. 

Releases more energy than [[Fission]] however fusion can only occur at extremely high temperatures.
Needs massive amount of energy to overcome [[electrostatic force]] of repulsion.
