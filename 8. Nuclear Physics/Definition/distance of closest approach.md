# distance of closest approach

As an[[ alpha particle]] is fired at a gold nucleus, it will have an initial [[kinetic energy]], however as it moves closely to the positively charged nucleus it will experience an [[electrostatic force]] of repulsion and slow down as its kinetic energy is turned into electric potential energy. 

The point kinetic energy = 0 is distance of closest approach

can calculate this distance by using :
