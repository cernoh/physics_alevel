# distance of closest approach

As an[[ alpha particle]] is fired at a gold nucleus, it will have an initial [[kinetic energy]], however as it moves closely to the positively charged nucleus it will experience an [[electrostatic force]] of repulsion and slow down as its kinetic energy is turned into electric potential energy. 

The point kinetic energy = 0 is distance of closest approach

can calculate this distance by using :

<font size = "5"> $$V = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}} \frac{Q}{r}$$</font>

[[electric potential]] , if we multiply by the charge of our particle, get the equation for electric potential energy.

<font size = "5"> $$E_{elec} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r}$$ </font>

where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space, $Q_{1}/Q_{2}$ is the charge of the nucleus/charged particle, r is the distance of centre of nucleus/distance of closest approach.

Distance of closest approach is not very accurate estimate, over an overestimate.
