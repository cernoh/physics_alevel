# 8.1.2 Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation
[[Radiation]]
Can become 3 different types of radiation, which are summarized as below

| Radiation      | Range in air                                | Ionising    | Deflected by electric and magnetic fields? | absorbed by?                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Alpha $\alpha$ | 2-10 cm                                     | Highly      | Yes                                        | Paper                                                |
| Beta $\beta$   | Around 1m                                   | Weakly      | Yes                                        | Aluminum foil (around 3mm)                           |
| Gamma $\gamma$ | Infinite range ; follows inverse square law | Very weakly | No                                         | Several metres of concrete or several inches of lead |

Due to their differing penetrating powers, these type of radiation emitted from a source can be easily identified using a simple experiment:
1. Using a [[geiger-muller tube]] and counter, find the [[]]
