# 8.1.2 Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation
[[Radiation]]
Can become 3 different types of radiation, which are summarized as below

| Radiation      | Range in air                                | Ionising    | Deflected by electric and magnetic fields? | absorbed by?                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Alpha $\alpha$ | 2-10 cm                                     | Highly      | Yes                                        | Paper                                                |
| Beta $\beta$   | Around 1m                                   | Weakly      | Yes                                        | Aluminum foil (around 3mm)                           |
| Gamma $\gamma$ | Infinite range ; follows inverse square law | Very weakly | No                                         | Several metres of concrete or several inches of lead |

Due to their differing penetrating powers, these type of radiation emitted from a source can be easily identified using a simple experiment:
1. Using a [[geiger-muller tube]] and counter, find the [[Background Radiation|background count]] when the source is not present
2. Place the source of radiation close to the GM tube and measure the count rate.
3. Place a sheet of paper between the source and GM tube and measure count rate again, if the count rate decreases significantly, then the source is emitting [[alpha particle|alpha radiation]]
4. Repeat aboee using aluminium foil and several inches of lead

### Gamma uses
Very weakly ionising . Used as:
- a detector - a radioactive source with a short half-life, which emits gamma radiation
