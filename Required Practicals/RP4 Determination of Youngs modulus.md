# RP4 Determination of Youngs modulus
## Equipment:  
- 2 1.5m long steel wires 
- Main scale and Vernier scale 
- 1kg masses and 2 1kg holders 
- Micrometer 
- Metre ruler

## Method: 
 - Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram. 
 - Measure the initial length l of the test wire with the metre ruler. 
 - Add a 1kg mass holder to both wires so they are taut and record the initial scale reading. 
 - Add an additional 1kg mass to the test wire and record the new scale reading. Find its extension e by subtracting the initial scale reading from this and record it. 
 - Add another 1kg mass and repeat this, adding 1kg each time up to around 8kg. 
 - Repeat the experiment twice more and find and record the mean e for each m, where m is the mass of the 1kg masses on the test wire’s holder. 
 - Measure the diameter d of the test wire at various points along it using the micrometer and find and record the mean diameter.

## Graphs and calculations: 
- Calculate the cross-sectional area A of the wire by A = 4 πd 2 
- Find the force F on the test wire for each m by calculating mg and tabulate this. 
- Plot a graph of F against e and draw a line of best fit. The young modulus E will be l multiplied by the gradient divided by A. 
- E = $\frac{stress}{strain}$ = $\frac{F/A}{e/l}$ = $\frac{Fl}{Ae}$ = $\frac{IG}{A}$ where G is the gradient.

## Safety:
- The wire will be stretched very tightly and could break and injure eyes, so safety goggles must be worn. 
- If the wire breaks, the masses could fall and cause injuries, so a sand tray should be placed beneath them to catch them.

## Improvements and notes:
- The comparison wire compensates for sagging of the beam and thermal expansion effects and provides a reference point against which to measure the extension. 
- The original length l of the test wire should be as long as possible to reduce uncertainty in its measurement.
