# RP4 Determination of Youngs modulus
Equipment:  
- 2 1.5m long steel wires 
- Main scale and Vernier scale 
- 1kg masses and 2 1kg holders 
- Micrometer 
- Metre ruler

 Method: 
 - Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram. 
 - Measure the initial length l of the test wire with the metre ruler. 
 - Add a 1kg mass holder to both wires so they are taut and record the initial scale reading. 
 - Add an additional 1kg mass to the test wire and record the new scale reading. Find its extension e by subtracting the initial scale reading from this and record it. 
 - Add another 1kg mass and repeat this, adding 1kg each time up to around 8kg. 
 - Repeat the experiment twice more and find and record the mean e for each m, where m is the mass of the 1kg masses on the test wireâ€™s holder. 
 - Measure the diameter d of the test wire at various points along it using the micrometer and find and record the mean diameter.
