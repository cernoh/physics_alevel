# RP5 Determine electrical resistivity of a material

## Equipment
- 1m long constantan wire 
- Voltmeter 
- Ammeter 
- Low voltage power supply 
- Micrometer 
- Metre ruler

## Method
- Measure the diameter d of the constantan wire at various points along it using the micrometer and find and record the mean diameter. 
- Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram. 
- Adjust the length l to 0.100m using the crocodile clips, measured using the metre ruler. 
- Read and record the current I on the ammeter and the voltage V on the voltmeter. Calculate the resistance R by using R=V/I and record this. 
- Increase l by 0.100m and repeat this, increasing it by 0.100m each time up to 0.800m. 
- Repeat the experiment twice more and find and record the mean R for each l.

## Graphs and calculations
- Calculate the cross-sectional area A of the wire by A = 4 πd 2 
- Plot a graph of the mean value of R against l and draw a line of best fit. The resistivity will be the gradient multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the wire. 
- ρ = A where G is the gradient.
