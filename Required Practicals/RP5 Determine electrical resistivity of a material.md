# RP5 Determine electrical resistivity of a material

## Equipment
- 1m long constantan wire 
- Voltmeter 
- Ammeter 
- Low voltage power supply 
- Micrometer 
- Metre ruler

## Method
Measure the diameter d of the constantan wire at various points along it using the micrometer and find and record the mean diameter. ○ Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram. ○ Adjust the length l to 0.100m using the crocodile clips, measured using the metre ruler. ○ Read and record the current I on the ammeter and the voltage V on the voltmeter. Calculate the resistance R by using R=V/I and record this. ○ Increase l by 0.100m and repeat this, increasing it by 0.100m each time up to 0.800m. ○ Repeat the experiment twice more and find and record the mean R for each l.
