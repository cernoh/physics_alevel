# resonance

Where the amplitude of oscillations of a system drastically increase due to gaining an increased amount of energy from the driving force.

However it cna be negative , as it can cause damage to a structure, such as when people walk on a bridge and provide a driving frequency close to the natural frequency, to oscillate the bridge violently.  Therefore [[]]
## Applications
- Instruments - Instruments such as a flute has a long tube in which air resonates , causing a [[Stationary Wave]]
- Radio - Tuned so electric circuit resonates at same frequency as desired broadcast frequency
- Swing - If someone pushes you they provide a driving frequency
